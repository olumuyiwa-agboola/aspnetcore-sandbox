# ASP.NET Core Sandbox
Welcome to my sandbox for learning and experimenting with the ASP.NET Core framework!

## 🎯 Learning Goals 
- Gain a deep understanding of ASP.NET Core's concepts, techniques, patterns and best practices.  
- Explore and experiment with core concepts such as dependency injection, application configuration, middleware pipeline etc.
- Work through the [ASP.NET Core documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/) one topic at a time.
- Learn ASP.NET Core's capabilities for building web APIs, web apps, hosted & background services, GRPC services and clients etc.
- Build projects to demonstrate concepts and reinforce learning.  
- Write clean, performant C# code following best practices.
